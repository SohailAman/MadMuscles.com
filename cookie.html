                                <p>A cookie is a small text file which is placed onto your device (e.g. computer, smartphone or other
                                    electronic device) when you visit our website to store a range of information, for example, your
                                    language preference, or browser and device you are using to view the website. Those cookies are set by
                                    us and called <em>first-party cookies</em>. We also use <em>third party cookies</em>, which are cookies
                                    from a domain different from the domain of our website, for our advertising and marketing efforts.</p>
                                <p><em>Session cookies</em> expire each time you close your browser and do not remain on your device
                                    afterwards. These cookies allow our website to link your actions during a particular browser session.
                                </p>
                                <p><em>Persistent cookies</em> will remain on your device for a period of time, and will expire on a set
                                    expiration date, or when you delete them manually from your cache. These cookies are stored on your
                                    device in between browser sessions and allow your preferences and actions across our website to be
                                    remembered.</p>
                                <h3 class="text-white">Similar technologies</h3>
                                <p>In addition to cookies, there are other similar technologies that may be used on the web or in mobile
                                    ecosystems.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Web beacon</em> is a small, transparent image (also known as “pixel tag”, “web bug”, “GIF”) that
                                        contains a unique identifier. It is embedded into a website or an email. When your browser reads the
                                        code of the website it communicates with our server in order to display the image and, through this
                                        process, we are able to acquire information such as technical specifications of your device,
                                        operating systems and settings being used. It can also track your activities during a session. Also,
                                        it enables us to recognize when each email was opened, from what IP address and from what device. We
                                        use this information to improve our email communication.</li>
                                    <li><em>Software development kits (SDK) </em>are third-party software development kits that may be
                                        installed in our mobile applications. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile
                                        applications and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the
                                        application.</li>
                                    <li><em>Local shared objects</em>, commonly called “Flash cookies”, are pieces of data that websites
                                        which use Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer to facilitate the Flash functionality. We may
                                        use Adobe Flash to display graphics, interactive animations and other enhanced functionality. Local
                                        shared objects can track similar parameters to cookies but they can also provide information on your
                                        use of the specific feature that the cookie is enabling. For example, if it facilitates the display
                                        of a video then we can receive details of how much of the video was watched and when viewing
                                        stopped. Flash cookie management tools can be accessed directly via <a
                                            href="http://www.adobe.com">www.adobe.com</a>.</li>
                                    <li><em>HTML5 local storage</em>. HTML 5 is the fifth version of the HTML language and contains
                                        functionality that allows information to be stored locally within the browser’s data files. HTML5
                                        local storage operates in a similar way to cookies but differs in that it can hold greater amounts
                                        of information and does not rely on an exchange of data with the website’s server.</li>
                                    <li><em>Fingerprinting</em> is a technique that involves combining a set of information elements in
                                        order to uniquely identify a particular device. These information elements include, for example:
                                        data from configuration of the device, CSS information, JavaScript objects, installed fonts,
                                        installed plugins with the browser, use of any APIs, HTTP header information, clock information.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><em>Device Identifiers</em> are identifiers comprised of numbers and letters, which are unique to
                                        each specific device. These include Apple’s ID for Advertisers (IDFA) and Google’s Android
                                        Advertising ID (AAID). They are stored on the device and are used to recognize you and your devices
                                        across different apps and devices for marketing and advertising purposes. You can reset your device
                                        identifier or opt out of personalized advertising in the settings of your device.</li>
                                    <li><em>Social widgets </em>are buttons or icons provided by third-party social media providers that
                                        allow you to interact with those social media services when you view a web page or a mobile app
                                        screen. These social widgets may collect browsing data, which may be received by the third party
                                        that provided the widget, and are controlled by the third parties.</li>
                                </ul>
