                <p>
                    The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional
                    rights to know, delete and opt-out, and requires us to disclose what
                    personal information we have collected, used, and shared over the last
                    12 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Section 2 describes the personal information we have collected about you,
                    including the sources of that information. We collect this information
                    for the purposes described in Section 3. We share this information as
                    described in Section 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under CCPA you as a California resident have the following rights, which
                    you may exercise by yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to
                    make these requests on your behalf:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Right of Know.</strong> You have the right to request that we
                    disclose to you the personal information we collect, use, or disclose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Right to Delete.</strong> You have the right to request that
                    we delete your personal information that we have collected from you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong> CCPA requires that we maintain a
                    separate webpage that allows you to opt out of the sale of your personal
                    information, which can be accessed by clicking the

                <p>
                    <strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> We will not discriminate
                    against you for exercising any of these rights. We will not deny you our
                    services, charge you different prices, or provide you a lower quality of
                    services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized
                    agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the
                    CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the
                    agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and
                    we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.

                    for achieving the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy (including
                    providing the Service to you), which includes (but is not limited to) the

                <p>
                    Various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a
                    DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a
                    signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT preference.
                    You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We currently do not support “Do Not Track” requests because no DNT standard
                    has been adopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our third-party services may collect information about you and your online
                    activities over time and across our Services and other online properties.
                    These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to
                    DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor
                    DNT settings. To determine whether any of the third-party services honor the
                    “Do Not Track” requests, please read their privacy policies.
