                                Company or through an App Store (the “Purchase”).</p>
                            <p>6.2. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change Purchase fees at
                                any time. We will
                                give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on the

                            <p>6.3. You authorize us and the App Stores to charge the applicable fees to the payment
                                method that you

                            <p>6.4. Our Service may offer subscriptions that automatically renew. Unless you cancel your
                                subscription
                                before the end of the subscription period, you authorize us to charge you for the

                                terms of autorenewal and cancellation procedure will be disclosed to you on the Service.
                            </p>
                            <p>6.5. Our Service may offer trial subscriptions that provide access to the Service for a
                                limited period of
                                time and auto renew unless you cancel before the end of the trial period. The terms of
                                the autorenewal
                                and cancellation procedure will be disclosed to you on the Service.</p>

                                liability. We

                            <p>6.8. Purchases made via an App Store are subject to such App Store's refund policies.
                                This means when a
                                Purchase is made through an App Store, we cannot grant refunds. You will have to contact
                                an App Store
                                support.</p>

                                non-exchangeable, unless otherwise is stated herein or is required by applicable law.

                                begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your
                                right of

                                eligible to a
                                refund, unless the digital content is defective.</p>

                                FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</p>
                            <p>11.4. Arbitration is more informal way to settle disputes than a lawsuit in court. A
                                neutral arbitrator
                                instead of a judge or jury is used in arbitration, which allows for more limited
                                discovery than in
                                court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The same damages and relief that
                                a court can
                                award can be awarded by arbitrators. Please see more information about arbitration at <a

                            <p>11.5. A party which intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written
                                notice of intent
                                to arbitrate (a “Notice”) by an international courier with a tracking mechanism, or, in
                                the absence of a
                                mailing address provided by you to us, via any other method available to us, including
                                via e-mail. The
                                Notice to the Company must be addressed to: 1ST FLOOR, GEORGIOU CHRISTOFOROU 8, 2012,
                                STROVOLOS,
                                NICOSIA, CYPRUS (as applicable, the “Arbitration Notice Address”). The Notice shall (i)
                                describe the
                                basis and nature of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set the specific relief sought (the
                                “Demand”). If you
                                and the Company do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the
                                Notice is
                                received, then you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or
                                file an individual
                                claim in small claims court.</p>
                            <p>11.6. THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) WILL EXCLUSIVELY ADMINISTER THE
                                ARBITRATION IN
                                ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR
                                CONSUMER RELATED
                                DISPUTES (THE “Rules”), AS MODIFIED BY THESE TERMS.</p>
                            <p>11.7. If you commence arbitration against us, you are required to provide a second Notice
                                to the Company
                                at the Arbitration Notice Address within seven (7) days of arbitration commencement. The
                                Rules and AAA

                                than $1,000 or was
                                filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the
                                filing fee, if you
                                are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against us, then we will
                                promptly reimburse
                                you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon our receipt of the second Notice
                                at the
                                Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt
                                evidencing payment
                                of the filing fee.</p>
                            <p>11.8. The arbitration shall be conducted exclusively in English. A single, independent
                                and impartial
                                arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in Alexandria, Virginia (if you are
                                from the United
                                States) or in Limassol, Republic of Cyprus (if you are not from the United States) will
                                be appointed
                                pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and the Company agree to comply with the
                                following rules,
                                which are intended to streamline the arbitration process and reduce the costs and
                                burdens on the
                                parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written
                                submissions, the
                                specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the
                                arbitration will not
                                require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
                                agreed in writing
                                by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be
                                entered in any court
                                of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>11.9. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT YOU AND
                                THE COMPANY MAY
                                BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
                                PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
                                MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU
                                AGREE THAT THE
                                ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT
                                OTHERWISE
                                PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC
                                PROVISION IS
                                FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL
                                BE NULL AND
                                VOID.</p>
                            <p>11.10. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute
                                relating to the
                                interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms,
                                the Privacy
                                Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole
                                authority to
                                determine whether this arbitration clause can be enforced against a non-party to this
                                agreement and
                                whether a non-party to these Terms can enforce its provision against you or us.</p>
                            <p>11.11. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her final,
                                confidential
                                decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may
                                extend this time
                                limit for an additional 30 days upon a showing of good cause and in the interests of
                                justice. All
                                arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records
                                relating thereto
                                will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the
                                arbitration award.
                                The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting
                                forth the reasons
                                for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the
                                Commonwealth of Virginia
                                without regard to its conflicts of laws principles in conducting the arbitration. You
                                acknowledge that
                                these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate
                                commerce. The
                                United States Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) will govern the interpretation,
                                enforcement, and
                                proceedings pursuant to this Section 11. Any award rendered shall be final, subject to
                                appeal under the
                                FAA.</p>
                            <p>11.12. The abovestated provisions of this Section 11 shall not apply to any claim in
                                which either party
                                seeks equitable relief to protect such party’s copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other
                                intellectual
                                property. For the avoidance of doubt, you agree that, in the event the Company or a
                                third party breaches
                                these Terms, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek
                                injunctive or other
                                equitable relief against us, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject
                                to the
                                limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.</p>
                            <p>11.13. You and we agree that, notwithstanding any other rights a party may have at law or
                                in equity, any
                                claim arising out of or related to these Terms (including the Privacy Policy) or the
                                Service, excluding
                                a claim for indemnification, must be initiated with the AAA or filed in small claims
                                court in
                                Alexandria, Virginia within one (1) year after the claim accrues. Otherwise, such cause
                                of action is
                                permanently and forever barred. This one (1) year period includes the thirty (30) day
                                pre-dispute
                                procedure set forth in sub-clause 13.5 above.</p>
                            <p>11.14. All claims you bring against the Company must be resolved in accordance with this
                                Section. All
                                claims filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed.
                                Should you file a
                                claim contrary to this Section, the Company may recover attorneys’ fees and
                                reimbursement of its costs,
                                provided that the Company has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and
                                you fail to
                                promptly withdraw such claim.</p>
                            <p>11.15. In the event that we make any material change to this arbitration provision (other
                                than a change
                                to our Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written
                                notice to our
                                Arbitration Notice Address within thirty (30) days of the change, in which case your
                                license to use the
                                Service will terminate immediately, and this Section, as in effect immediately prior to
                                the amendments
                                you reject, will survive the termination of these Terms.</p>
                            <p>11.16. If only Section 11.9 above or the entirety of this Section 11 is found to be
                                unenforceable, then
                                the entirety of this Section 11 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties
                                agree that the
                                exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 12 will govern any action arising
                                out of or
                                related to this Agreement.</p>
                            <p>11.17. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO
                                HAVE A JUDGE OR
                                JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU
                                UNDERSTAND AND
                                AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND
                                CONFIDENTIAL
                                ARBITRATION.</p>
                            <p>11.18. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30)
                                DAYS FROM THE DATE
                                THAT YOU FIRST USE, OR ATTEMPT TO USE, THE SERVICE BY WRITING TO <a

                            <p>12.1. The laws of Cyprus, excluding its conflicts of law principles, govern these Terms
                                and your use of

                                to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and

                            <p>18.2. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is determined to be
                                unlawful, void, or
                                unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these
                                Terms and does not
                                affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
                                venture,
